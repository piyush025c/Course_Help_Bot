# Course Chat Bot

Nowdays Education has taken a shift to online platforms. This has increased the workload of Faculties. We propose an idea of a ***ChatBot*** which trys to resolve this issue by entertaining the general queries of students. This comes as a handy feature and is available even when faculties are not around us.

---

We have built an ***Android App*** through which a student can navigate to a specific course and can chat with course chatbot. This bot is capable of resolving some day to day doubts related to class timings, class notes, etc. 
It can also be made to respond to queries related to recent announcements.

##### We have also tried to built a web platform to handle students query. It sets up a chat session where students can put their doubts.
